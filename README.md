# UFOs

## <u>Project Overview</u>
The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive webpage that shows information of reported UFO sightings. The webpage includes a dynamic table, and filtered search bars. By using `HTLM`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` it was possible to develop and customize **UFO sightings** webpage.

## <u>Results</u>
The picture below shows the home page of our website. Square number **(1)** shows the filter bar. Square number **(2)** shows all the sightings data in an interactive table.

There are several filter options to filter by: date, city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO.


Example 1: Filter by El Cajon, CA.

## <u>Summary</u>

**Drawbacks**

- The filter field is case sensitive and if it is not entered as required then the table will not update.
- The data is outdated and limited.

**Recommendations**
- Customizing the search bar by including a drop-down list, and autofill could make it easier for the user and make the page more interactive.

- The data could be pulled from live source in order to show updated results.
